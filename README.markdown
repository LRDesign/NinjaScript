## NinjaScript
NinjaScript is a jQuery library designed to allow unobstrusive scripting simply
and easily.  Essentially, we use jQuery selectors to apply behavior the same
way we use CSS stylesheets to apply stylings.  Additionally, NinjaScript makes
it easy to package up useful behaviors and apply them quickly to disparate
elements, or in different projects.

## Contributing

To contribute to NinjaScript, fork it on GitHub and issue pull requests.   Make 
sure you run the tests; this can be accomplished just by loading the file 
"SpecRunner.html" in a browser, locally.  All the test libraries necessary are 
hosted on http://js-testing.lrdesign.com, so it should just work.
