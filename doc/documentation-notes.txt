NinjaScript docco is divided into levels ala Go or Kendo:

* Use selectors to apply pre-packaged behaviors
* More complex pre-packaged behaviors - configs especially
* How selectors apply (the "View Source" model)
* Using 3rd-party behaviors
* Variants of behavior def: functions, objects, arrays
* Ad hoc behaviors: events
* Three brothers: event.target, handler( ,elem), this.element
* Ad hoc behaviors: transforms
* Ad hoc behaviors: context-shared data
* Prepackaged behaviors and compositing
